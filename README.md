#  Resort Rentals with React

## Resort Rentals built with..
*  React
*  React Router
*  React Icons
*  Context API
*  CSS
*  Styled Components
*  Contentful for data storage

This fantastic tutorial project was created by John Smilga, big thanks to him. I refactored all of the class based components into functional components with hooks, however, I left the context component as class based. I changed the data content and photos as well.
